Grades (and standardized testing in general) have never been my friend. I can get A's in my calculus classes but
tested far below average for math on the SAT. It's confusing to me! Classes I hate I can get good grades in while
the one's I love I can barely pass sometimes. The hated classes are also the ones I barely remember being in.

For me, I've never been grade motivated but I love to learn. In high school I was a 4.0 student but only because I
actually showed up and did the work (somewhat mindlessly). I don't think I ever retained anything. In college I've struggled
a lot more. It's not enough to show up anymore- for most classes. During the Gen Eds I could BS a paper the night
before and get great grades (with no real take-away) but with my statistics, computer science, and language classes
I put all the effort in and am mediocre grade-wise. Despite the grades I know what I like doing and studying.The art of
BS-ing is one I think most students know well. And it's all for a grade- do we actually take away anything from those
classes? It's working for a grade not for the purpose of learning.

I don't know how motivated I would be towards classes I'm not particularly interested in, maybe the grade is the only thing
that kept me going? I'd hope removing the grades would allow students to become more involved in a subject but if it's
something that particular student isn't interested in then I don't know what would keep them motivated. High school in
particular is so general that students may not be in classes they are interested in a majority of the time. Would no grades
work well there? Maybe it'd work better in a college-level setting where students are picking the classes they enroll in.

My Japanese classes with Jason Herlands are not grade based and are also ones I am highly motivated in. It involves a lot of
hands-on activities with real-world applications. It's a very small class size as well which I believe greatly helps. We get
a lot of interaction with other students and with the professor; so we are constantly recieving feedback from both. We are
also asked to reflect on goals and progress often. For these reasons I believe the class works very well.
